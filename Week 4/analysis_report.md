## Most Placed Pixel Reports

  The three most placed pixels, in order, occurred at coordinates (0,0), (359,564), and (349,564). The (0,0) coordinate is not particularly interesting as it is the top left most pixel of the canvas and remains white or black for a vast majority of the time. However, the pixel war occurring at the other two points is fascinating. 
  
  After investigating the r/place public atlas displaying the final visualization of the place project, I discovered that the second and third most placed coordinates occurred at the center of the two eyes of a skull figure. This passes the sniff test too as the coordinates (349,564) and (359,564) are parallel along the line y = 564. Upon further research, I learned that the skull icon is the symbol of the Straw Hat (Mugiwara) Pirates. The Straw Hat Pirates are the main characters of the anime series One Piece. The r/OnePiece subreddit has proudly signed their name above their masterpiece. 

  The two most common colors, by far, for both of these pixels were black and spray (a bright, light blue similar to cyan) respectively (as shown by the bar plots in the analysis notebook). This is the key war that we see at these two pixels. Several public timelapses of r/place lifespan show the eyes of the "straw hat pirate" oscillate between being all black and having a speck of blue in the center. 

  It is important to note that the One Piece official logo for the Straw Hat Pirates is a skull with eye holes that are completely black. Thus it seems that the truthers of r/OnePiece wanted to keep their rendition of the Pirates logo as cannon accurate as possible. This begs the question though, who would be so passionate about changing the color of the eyes to the point of these pixels being the most frequently hit? 

  My first assumption was that it was simply some trolls: people intent on disparaging, annoying, and prodding the dedicated artists of r/OnePiece. Perhaps there was a group who strongly disliked the One Piece franchise. However, upon further research, it turns out that the skull resembles the skull of beloved, blue-eyed skeleton, Sans, from the videogame, Undertale. 

  The artists of r/Undertale also conspired to contribute to r/place, and in fact, they claimed their own section of the canvas and designed several characters from the game, including Sans. However, it seems likely that users from r/Undertale discovered the Straw Hat Pirates logo and sought to make the skull more Sans-like. 

  The contention over the eye color began in the early hours of the project, and the fierce war that followed did not seem to end until users could only place white pixels. Both sides fought valiantly and, as a result, caused the two pixels (359,564), and (349,564) to be the second and third most hit pixel.
